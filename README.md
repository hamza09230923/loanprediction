# Loan Default Prediction for Financial Risk Management
1. Introduction & Business Problem
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. For financial institutions, the ability to predict loan defaults is critical for mitigating financial risk, making informed lending decisions, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

By leveraging historical loan application data, this model provides a data-driven approach to assessing credit risk, helping to distinguish between applicants who are likely to repay a loan and those who are not. This ultimately leads to a healthier loan portfolio and reduced financial losses.
